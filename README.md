Hi! I'm Miguel, curious about everything related to Linux, Cybersecurity and Software Development. I almost never have a blank mind, as I like to think about everyday problems and try to solve them with code.

My journey in the tech world has been a whirlwind of emotions, driven by my ability to learn quickly.

When I'm not immersed in lines of code or learning something new, you'll find me enjoying nature, a good book, or experimenting with a new recipe in the kitchen.

If you are passionate about Linux, cybersecurity or technology in general, get in touch! If you want to exchange ideas, tackle coding challenges or just chat about the latest tech trends, I'm always ready.
